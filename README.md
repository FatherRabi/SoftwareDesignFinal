# Project Proposal

THE SCHEDULER (DUN DUN DUUUUUN) 

Project Description: 

The project I am proposing is a program that would automate the boring stuff when it comes to daily online activities, in particular for this assignment this program will make the process of signing up for classes a breeze. The program will open up TUportal and sign you up for the courses you input into it in a matter of seconds. Which will greatly benefit students due to the fact that a lot of courses have a limit to the number of students who can sign up, and this program will allow you to beat the rest to the punch. The other uses of a program like this are limitless, which is another reason why I wanted to work on something like this. We could make the program customizable so that it can log you into social networks and post on your behalf, or if you're a business owner this program could log in and pull/collect data in a matter of seconds while you're still getting your morning cup of coffee. 

 

Educational Goals: 

This project would fit all aspects of the educational goals for this class, the assignment will be highly collaborative and utilize every aspect of GitHub, each member will have a different task that they will work on, each using their own branch that would be merged into the main later (The main branch will be protected so it will also require multiple looks from the other programmers before it can be merged). Many tests will need to be coded to make sure everything is running smoothly, and so we are not testing the correctness of code through print statements/display which will only make the code more complicated and Frankley unprofessional. We will also have to create a UML so each programmer can see what the overall parts of the program will look like, and how they connect with each other.  

 

Our Contribution: 

Our contribution to the is assignment is simple. Now there are a few issues that need to be resolved with the base code for this program. First, it is in Visual Basics, which is essentially a dead language and not very user friendly. We would need to update the code to a more intuitive language (I’m thinking python unless C or Java is required per prof) and secondly the code isn’t very customizable, it only serves one purpose and the most basic version of that purpose. I’d like to add some extra functions to the code to make it run better and accomplish more than just one basic task.

URL: The base code was not online; I have a friend who built a similar program in order to pull data from multiple spreadsheets and compile all the data for him. His automating of this part of his job not only saved him hours upon hours of time, but it also got him a promotion due to the companies interested in the program. (I have the source code)
