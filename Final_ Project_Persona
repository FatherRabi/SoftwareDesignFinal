**Tony, Graphic Design Junior**
***

Tony, age 20 is a Junior who recently transfered to Temple Universuty, seeking a degree in Graphic Design.
This is Tony's first time in philadelphia and interacting with any of Temple registration features. Tony was not given a proper rundown 
on how to sign up for classes and is not familiar with temple system. He is very stressed because he does not know which classes he needs to 
take for his major, and is worried that he will miss priorty registration thus missing the opportunity to sign up for classes that he 
needs.Tony has been asking faculty if there is an application that will register course for him in a timely manner and recommend ones he 
should take for his major. He knows the banner exists but wants to know if there something else that offers more than what banner offers, like something that gives him a plan thats already made for him.
