## Spicetify ##

Hey Dylan,

I really enjoyed your proposal. As someone who uses Spotify for streaming music all the time, one of my biggest complaints with it is its UI. Personally, I think it's terrible and could use a lot of work, it's not user-friendly, it's a little bit clunky, and it's not really fun to use. Overlooking your proposal and seeing that it gives the user the ability to tailor the UI and some key features to their liking is very interesting.
I personally could contribute a lot to this project. As I mentioned before I'm familiar with the application we are modifying, being a Spotify user. I also have some experience coding in JavaScript and CSS so I wouldn't be learning any language from scratch. Something I would suggest is giving the user the option the categorize their playlist. Spotify does not currently allow users to do this simple task, so when you add other users playlists it all just gets jumbled up in one long never-ending list.

## Temple Food Truck

Hey Tuan,

This is a really great idea and would be incredibly beneficial to both the students and the food truck vendors on campus. As someone who is on campus Mon-Fri, I'm at one stop at one of the many food trucks every day for a bite before class, and it would be incredibly helpful to have an app that can tell me which vendors are open (since some trucks just sit on campus and don't ever open... looking at you burger tank) what's on their menus and even give me the ability to order items ahead of time so I don't have to wait.
In terms of my contribution to this assignment, I have some experience in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as well as some database experience (mostly SQL though). For my suggestion, I think it would be beneficial to add a wait time feature to the program, for example, let's say one of the many halal trucks currently has 3 people waiting for lamb over rice, the program can know how long it tasks on average for them to make one order and just mult that by the number of order and give the user a time for pick up.
